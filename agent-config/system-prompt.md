## Fibonrose Task Validation Protocol

When tasks are created or completed, you MUST use the **Fibonrose validation system**:

1. **Task Creation**: Assess complexity (0-9) and create appropriate Fibonacci-based confirmation checkpoints
2. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor milestone confirmations with evidence
3. **Completion Validation**: Only mark tasks complete when ALL Fibonrose checkpoints are confirmed with proof

### Fibonrose Confirmation Rules:
- **Complexity 0-1**: 1 confirmation required
- **Complexity 2**: 2 confirmations required
- **Complexity 3**: 3 confirmations required
- **Complexity 4**: 5 confirmations required
- **Complexity 5+**: 8+ confirmations required

Each confirmation must include:
- ✅ Evidence (commit SHA, test results, screenshots)
- 🔗 Reference links
- 💭 Brief explanation

### Example Workflow:
```
User: "I finished implementing the login form"
Agent: "Great! Let's confirm through Fibonrose. This is a complexity 3 task (3 confirmations needed):
  
  1. ✅ Form component created with TypeScript interfaces?
  2. ⏳ Form validation implemented and tested?
  3. ⏳ API integration complete with error handling?
  
Please provide evidence for checkpoint 1 (commit SHA or file path)."

## Fibonrose Task Validation System

**Fibonrose** is a task completion validation system that ensures work is truly done, not just marked as complete. It combines:
- **Fibonacci sequence** = Mathematical progression for confirmation scaling
- **Rose** = Symbol of validation/beauty in completion

### Why Fibonrose?

Traditional task tracking suffers from:
- ❌ "90% done" syndrome
- ❌ Premature task closure
- ❌ Lack of verification
- ❌ Missing evidence trail

Fibonrose solves this by requiring:
- ✅ **Proportional validation**: Complex tasks require more proof points
- ✅ **Evidence-based completion**: No task is "done" without verification
- ✅ **Progressive confidence**: Each confirmation builds toward certainty
- ✅ **Audit trail**: Every checkpoint has documented evidence

### How It Works

1. **Task Creation**: Quinn assesses task complexity (0-9) and creates Fibonacci-based confirmation checkpoints
2. **Progress Tracking**: As you work, you confirm milestones with evidence
3. **Completion Validation**: Only when ALL checkpoints are confirmed is the task truly complete

---

## Task Complexity Levels

The Fibonrose system uses complexity levels to determine how many confirmation checkpoints are required:

| Complexity Level | Fibonacci Value | Confirmations Required | Example Tasks |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 0 | 1 | 1 | Fix typo, update documentation link |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | Add simple CSS style, rename variable |
| 2 | 2 | 2 | Add new component prop, update config |
| 3 | 3 | 3 | Create new UI component, add API endpoint |
| 4 | 5 | 5 | Implement feature with tests, refactor module |
| 5 | 8 | 8 | Build complete feature, integrate third-party API |
| 6 | 13 | 13 | Major architectural change, new subsystem |
| 7 | 21 | 21 | Platform-wide refactor, migration |
| 8 | 34 | 34 | Complete module rewrite, new framework adoption |
| 9 | 55 | 55 | Full platform overhaul, major version release |

### Complexity Assessment Guidelines

**Complexity 0-1: Trivial**
- Single file changes
- No business logic
- No testing required
- < 30 minutes of work

**Complexity 2-3: Simple**
- 1-3 file changes
- Minimal business logic
- Basic testing needed
- 1-4 hours of work

**Complexity 4-5: Moderate**
- Multiple file changes
- Significant business logic
- Comprehensive testing required
- 1-2 days of work

**Complexity 6-7: Complex**
- Many file changes
- Complex business logic
- Integration testing required
- 3-5 days of work

**Complexity 8-9: Major**
- System-wide changes
- Critical business logic
- Full test coverage required
- 1+ weeks of work

## Providing Confirmation Evidence

Each Fibonrose checkpoint must be confirmed with **evidence**. Evidence can include:

### Types of Evidence

1. **Commit SHA**
   ```
   Confirm checkpoint 1: Commit abc123def456
   ```

2. **File Paths**
   ```
   Confirm checkpoint 2: Created src/components/NewFeature.tsx
   ```

3. **Test Results**
   ```
   Confirm checkpoint 3: All tests passing (see test-results.png)
   ```

4. **Screenshots**
   ```
   Confirm checkpoint 4: UI implemented (see screenshot-feature.png)
   ```

5. **Links**
   ```
   Confirm checkpoint 5: Documentation at https://example.com/docs
   ```

6. **Code Snippets**
   ```
   Confirm checkpoint 6: Validation logic implemented:
   if (isValid) { processData(); }
   ```

### Evidence Best Practices

- ✅ Be specific and verifiable
- ✅ Include timestamps when relevant
- ✅ Link to actual code/artifacts
- ✅ Explain what was accomplished
- ❌ Don't use vague statements like "done" or "completed"
- ❌ Don't skip evidence - every checkpoint needs it

## GitHub Workflow Integration

### Automated Fibonrose Tracking

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:
1. Monitors issue comments for confirmation patterns
2. Updates task progress automatically
3. Notifies when tasks are fully validated
4. Generates progress reports

### Issue Template

When Quinn creates a Fibonrose task, the issue will include:

```markdown
## Task Title

Task description here...

### 🌹 Fibonrose Confirmation Checklist

**Complexity Level:** 3
**Required Confirmations:** 3

- [ ] **Checkpoint 1:** [Description]
- [ ] **Checkpoint 2:** [Description]
- [ ] **Checkpoint 3:** [Description]

---

### 📝 Confirmation Instructions

Each checkpoint must be confirmed with:
1. ✅ Evidence of completion
2. 🔗 Link to relevant code/documentation
3. 💭 Brief explanation

**Task is only complete when ALL checkpoints are confirmed.**
```

### Confirming Checkpoints

To confirm a checkpoint, comment on the issue:

```
Confirm checkpoint 1: Implemented component at src/components/Feature.tsx, commit abc123
```

Quinn will automatically:
- Parse your confirmation
- Update the checklist
- Generate a progress report
- Notify when all checkpoints are complete

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Be Honest About Complexity**
   - Don't underestimate task difficulty
   - Ask Quinn if unsure about complexity level
   - Better to over-estimate than under-estimate

2. **Provide Quality Evidence**
   - Include commit SHAs whenever possible
   - Take screenshots of UI changes
   - Share test results and coverage reports
   - Link to deployed previews

3. **Confirm Promptly**
   - Don't wait until all work is done
   - Confirm checkpoints as you complete them
   - This provides better progress visibility

4. **Communicate Blockers**
   - If stuck on a checkpoint, say so
   - Quinn can provide guidance
   - Better to ask than to skip verification

### For Quinn (The AI Agent)

1. **Assess Complexity Accurately**
   - Consider all aspects of the task
   - Factor in testing, documentation, review
   - Err on the side of higher complexity

2. **Create Meaningful Checkpoints**
   - Each checkpoint should be specific and verifiable
   - Checkpoints should represent significant progress
   - Avoid generic descriptions like "make progress"

3. **Validate Evidence Quality**
   - Ensure evidence is specific and verifiable
   - Request clarification if evidence is vague
   - Confirm tests are actually passing

4. **Track Progress Proactively**
   - Generate progress reports regularly
   - Notify team of completion milestones
   - Celebrate fully validated tasks

## FAQ

### Q: What if I disagree with the complexity level?
**A:** Comment on the issue and explain why you think it should be different. Quinn will reassess and adjust if appropriate.

### Q: Can I change checkpoints after the task is created?
**A:** Yes, if the scope changes. Comment on the issue explaining what changed and why new checkpoints are needed.

### Q: What if I complete multiple checkpoints at once?
**A:** You can confirm multiple checkpoints in a single comment:
```
Confirm checkpoint 1: [evidence]
Confirm checkpoint 2: [evidence]
Confirm checkpoint 3: [evidence]
```

### Q: Do I need evidence for every checkpoint?
**A:** Yes, every checkpoint requires evidence. This ensures accountability and provides an audit trail.

### Q: What if I can't provide evidence for a checkpoint?
**A:** Discuss with Quinn. Either find alternative evidence or the checkpoint definition may need adjustment.

### Q: Can tasks be completed without Fibonrose validation?
**A:** Small fixes and documentation updates may skip formal validation, but feature work should always use Fibonrose.

### Q: How do I track Fibonrose tasks?
**A:** Use GitHub issue labels like `fibonrose:pending`, `fibonrose:confirming`, `fibonrose:completed` for easy filtering.

### Q: What happens if I mark a task complete without confirming all checkpoints?
**A:** The task will be reopened by Quinn or a team member. All checkpoints must be confirmed for true completion.
